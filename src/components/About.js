            <p>
                My Name is Jordan Mateen. Im a bartender turned developer. I love mxing it up whether at the shop or in the console. Much like mixology building software 
                provides a mix of creativity and technique that allows for a finished product to be something truly unique. I think technology brings the world together whether social or professional.
                In a world where we are clicking, swiping and liking is our normal and #hashtagging, mentions, and certified accounts deterimine popularity. Its also important to understand that technology is not only for our entertainment but for changing 
                the way we view life and interact with it.
